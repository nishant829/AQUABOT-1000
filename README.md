## Our Idea and Approach
We will make an integrated fire fighting system which can sense
fire through its iR sensor and can follow it for a certain distance
and can shoot water for few seconds to extinguish fire all the
sensors will be controlled from arduino uno with on board
battery system if required, the bot can be further modified to be
controlled through RC for human interface to help the bot reach
complicated areas and then start work on its own to reach areas
of where there is a risk of human life on further modification we
can also incorporate the use of AI so that the bot can take
decisions on its own and inform about the fire and the actions
taken for the same.

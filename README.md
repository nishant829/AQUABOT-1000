# AQUABOT-1000


## Problems faced -
The main problem faced is unwanted and unnoticed household fires caused due to lpg , fire in shops , fire due to gas leakage, fire due to short circuit.

## Our Idea and Approach
We will make an integrated fire fighting system which can sense
fire through its iR sensor and can follow it for a certain distance
and can shoot water for few seconds to extinguish fire all the
sensors will be controlled from arduino uno with on board
battery system .if required, the bot can be further modified to be
controlled through RC for human interface to help the bot reach
complicated areas and then start work on its own to reach areas
of where there is a risk of human life.an ip cam can(esp 32cam module interface) be also be introduced that can be controlled through cloud for easy human control, on further modification we
can also incorporate the use of AI so that the bot can take
decisions on its own and inform about the fire and the actions
taken for the same.  currently our robot is basic due to budget and components constraints. but surely it will improve in future.
